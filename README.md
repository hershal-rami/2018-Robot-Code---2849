# 2018-Robot-Code---2849
2018 Ursa Major 2849 Welcome to the 2018 Programming Conglomeration GitHub Repository, this is where all of our code will be placed.

###Git Quick Reference for team members

#####Add repo to your computer

In the command line, type

git clone https://github.com/teamursamajor/2018-Robot-Code---2849
This clones the 2018 Robot Code repository to your computer, Git will now track any changes you make to existing files.

#####Adding files If you created a new file or changed a file, such as "Drive.java", you will need to tell Git to track this change. Simply type

git add Drive.java
replacing Drive.java with the file you want to add, Git will now "stage" that change.

#####Deleting files If you want to remove a file from the repository, type

git rm Drive.java
or whatever file you want to delete. This deletes the file from your computer as well.

#####Checking your files Typing

git status
will tell you the status of your files, such as what has been added, modified, or deleted. Files under "Changes to be committed:" will be committed to the repository, while files under "Changes not staged for commit:" will need to be added before committing to make the changes permanent.

#####Committing: Your code needs to be committed after you have made changes. Otherwise, the changes will only stay on your computer and not be added to the online repository. Typing

git commit
will launch a text editor and allow you to add a message to your commit. The commit message should describe the changes you made, and if you leave it blank, it will not commit. If you want to skip opening the editor, typing

git commit -m [message]
where [message] is your message will allow you to add a message without opening the editor. You can also skip the "add" command with

git commit -a
which will automatically add all files that have been changed. It will NOT add files that have been created. To add all content modified/created/removed (potentially dangerous, be aware when using) use the command

git add -A
#####Pushing: After committing, you must push your code to the repository to save your changes. Simply type

git push
and you will be prompted for your username and password. Use teamursamajor's username and password.

Good practice is to commit often and push your commits at the end of the day. This is your responsibility. Sign your commits with your name or your programming name at the end of each commit.
