Priorities:
adjust arcade drive
FMS
talon srx
test intake while driving
calibrate lift encoder
test automodes (and finalize, ie deploying intake)
fix shuffleboard (may not actually be possible)
fix debugselector because it is an absolute broken mess now ("nice" -20XX)
-- only the toggle switch thing is broken, and it seems to be a bug with smartdashboard; not something we can control. could just go with a dropdown menu. probably better in the long run if smartdashboard resets every time it's opened
2 cube pathfinder autos
comment/clean code
remove separate Pathmaker project (what is spline?)

Ongoing:
dropbox with the jars/gitbash?
sourcetree
meld (visual merge tool)
password recovery software (windows 10 compatible)
limelight
hackerman
update eclipse
scouting
fast led
